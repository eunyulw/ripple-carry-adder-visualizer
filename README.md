# Ripple Carry Adder Visualizer

A C-based simulation of a 4-bit ripple carry adder with an animated ASCII art visualization. Shows the step-by-step process of binary addition, including carry propagation, visually. 


## Trying Out...
- **Practicing Git and C**: For fun. 
- **Animated Visualization**: Uses ASCII art and `sleep` to show the ripple effect of carry propagation across bits.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures only valid 4-bit binary numbers (0s and 1s) are accepted.
- **Circuit-Like Display**: Represents bits and operations with box-like structures and arrows.
